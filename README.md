**Power BI Dashboard: Student Aid Trends WNE University**

This project analyzes financial aid trends at Western New England University using data collected from the university website. After downloading and cleaning the dataset in Excel, I imported it into Power BI to build interactive dashboards.

The visualizations highlight long‑term trends for degree/certificate‑seeking students—covering grant aid, Pell Grants, and federal loans—and include a focused 2023 snapshot for non‑degree students. The dashboard reveals changes in aid distribution, award amounts, and student eligibility over time.

**Tools Used:** Excel, Power BI

**Skills Demonstrated:** Data collection, cleaning, visualization, trend analysis
